Subject: TAS000004742054:FS extension

Hi Adrian,

For the subjected task ,disk is not visible after adding from xen farm node. We have removed and reattached disk to the Vm and checked all the configuration from farm end everything looks good but it is not reflecting in VM to extend the FS. We need to reboot the VM to fix the issue. Please provide the suitable DT for the same.

Reboot required: lpitojenkins01
