================
On 27 May, someone added new FS sapdata15 and did not make it part of veritas so it will create problem while package switching to other node.

Need this new FS to be controlled by veritas , so asked AO to bring down the COP as the new FS is in use and not able to correct online.

what is it?
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:07 PM] Raj Suchetan, (Suchetan.Raj@partner.bmw.de): 
there was new Filesystem created by someone recently on prod instance, and that needs to be made part of veritas now

The person just added the new filesystem, which is now controlled by OS not by veritas
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:08 PM] Swaminathan Hari, (Hari.Swaminathan@partner.bmwgroup.com): 
oh
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:08 PM] Raj Suchetan, (Suchetan.Raj@partner.bmw.de): 
So, I need to correct it now so prod package also need to be down 
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:09 PM] Swaminathan Hari, (Hari.Swaminathan@partner.bmwgroup.com): 
Can we pls check with AO.. Looks they have some critical task in non prod today..
means need downtime for prod?
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:11 PM] Raj Suchetan, (Suchetan.Raj@partner.bmw.de): 
I have added Christiaan for asking the same, but it seems he is away
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:12 PM] Swaminathan Hari, (Hari.Swaminathan@partner.bmwgroup.com): 
ok. lets wait..
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:18 PM] Raj Suchetan, (Suchetan.Raj@partner.bmw.de): 
Do you have ideo on AO side whom to contact
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:18 PM] Swaminathan Hari, (Hari.Swaminathan@partner.bmwgroup.com): 
It should be Christiaan..
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:19 PM] Raj Suchetan, (Suchetan.Raj@partner.bmw.de): 
hmm, ok
I just tried calling him, not picking up
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:20 PM] Swaminathan Hari, (Hari.Swaminathan@partner.bmwgroup.com): 
hmm.. Let me check in sapinfo if any other name I could find..
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:21 PM] Raj Suchetan, (Suchetan.Raj@partner.bmw.de): 
Are you sure there is no downtime for prod package , it should be there as the change is planned accordingly I guess
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:22 PM] Swaminathan Hari, (Hari.Swaminathan@partner.bmwgroup.com): 
we should not stop it explicitly.. only cluster can migrate...
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:23 PM] Raj Suchetan, (Suchetan.Raj@partner.bmw.de): 
hmm
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:23 PM] Swaminathan Hari, (Hari.Swaminathan@partner.bmwgroup.com): 
Also Chriatiaan explicity pinged me to inform him if any issue comes.
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:23 PM] Raj Suchetan, (Suchetan.Raj@partner.bmw.de): 
no for correcting the new filesystem, I need to package to be down, later we can make it up and test the cluster switch
[‎6/‎14/‎2020 12:24 PM] Swaminathan Hari, (Hari.Swaminathan@partner.bmwgroup.com): 
agreed.. But without AO confirmation, we cannot stop the system to fix the FS issue..
I could see these contact details..
